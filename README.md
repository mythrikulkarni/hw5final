## Assignment Rundown

<p>For this assignment, we were tasked with creating three different 
  programs representing the three different locations in the story: Little 
  Red Riding Hood's home, the forest, and Grandma's home. We need to 
  transport the Persons and Things from one location to the next using the 
  move function.</p>

### To Run:
<p>After compiling, run Hw5GrandmaHome, then Hw5Forest, then Hw5Home on a split terminal. After running Hw5Home, Hw5GrandmaHome should return that the status was successful 4 times, Hw5Forest should return the dump2JSON of each Person or Thing object twice and also report that the status was successful, and Hw5Home should have the same output as Hw5Forest. </p>

*Please adjust Makefile* `LDFLAGS` *for relevant operating system*
